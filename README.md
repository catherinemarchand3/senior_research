## The Effects of a VPN on Network Packets
*Catherine M, Nick M, Vinay P.* 

A VPN is a current solution to the ever-present issue of establishing security for private
information, especially when it concerns public networks. A VPN is a shield to all information -
it works as a tunnel, covering all data - this is accomplished through the use of encryption of the
data. The objective of this project is to show that all data will be better protected if there is a
VPN presence attached. We will test different security, with and without a VPN - this will be
through a p2p sharing process. We will also compare various VPN packets with WireShark. This
study would be instrumental in creating a safer environment for the data that is crucial to protect. 
This is important for personal use, but this methodology would also be useful for large
corporations that thrive on the promise that all data will be protected.
